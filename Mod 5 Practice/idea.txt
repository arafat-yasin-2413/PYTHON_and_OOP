We define a BankAccount class with three methods:

__init__: This is the constructor that initializes the account with an optional initial balance. By default, it's set to 0.


deposit: This method allows you to deposit money into the account. It checks if the amount is positive before updating the balance.


withdraw: This method allows you to withdraw money from the account, but it checks if the withdrawal amount is valid (positive and within the account balance).


check_balance: This method displays the current account balance.
We create a my_account object by calling BankAccount(100), which initializes the account with an initial balance of $100.

We perform some operations on the account:

Deposit $50 using my_account.deposit(50).
Withdraw $30 using my_account.withdraw(30).
Check the account balance using my_account.check_balance().
